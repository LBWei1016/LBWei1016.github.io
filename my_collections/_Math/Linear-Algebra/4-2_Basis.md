*Define:*
> A ***basis*** for a vector space $$V$$ is a *linearly independent* subset of $$V$$ that *spans* $$V$$.

## Theorem

> Every basis for the same vector space $$V$$ has the idnetical number of vectors, which equals to $$dim(V)$$.

*Proof:*

Let $$V_0 = \{\boldsymbol{v_i}\ | \ 1\leq i \leq n\}$$ and $$W = \{\boldsymbol{w_i}\ | \ 1\leq i \leq m\}$$ are both basis of $$V$$.

(i)

Assume $$n > m$$
