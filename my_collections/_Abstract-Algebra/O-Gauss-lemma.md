## Definition (content)
> For an **integer** polynomial $$f(x) = a_nx^n+\cdots+a_0$$, we define the content of $$f(x)$$ to be $$\gcd(a_0,\cdots,a_n)$$, denoted by $$\text{Con}(f)$$.

> When $$\text{Con}(f) = 1$$, $$f(x)$$ is called **primitive**.

### Theorem (product of primitive)
> If $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ are primitive, so is $$f(x)g(x)$$.
