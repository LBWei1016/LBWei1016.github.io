## Primitive Element Theorem
### Definition (separable polynomials)
> A polynomial $$f(x)\in F[x]$$ is called **separable** if it has **no repeated zeros** in **$$\bar F$$**.

### Theorem (who is separable?)
> Every *irreducible* polynomial of a **finite field** or a field with **characteristic zero** is **separable**. 
>
> In particular, if $$F$$ is an infinite field with $$\text{char}F \not = 0$$, $$f(x)\in F[x]$$ may have repeated zeros.

### Theorem (Primitive Element Theorem)
> Every *finite* extension $$E$$ over a field $$F$$ of **characteristic zero** is a **simple** extension.
