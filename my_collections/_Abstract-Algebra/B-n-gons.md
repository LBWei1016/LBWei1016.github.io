## The Order of the Symmetry Group
Let $$G$$ be the group of symmetries of some object $$X$$. Fix a point $$x$$ in $$X$$, let 

$$G_x = \{gx|g \in G\},$$

called the **$$G$$-orbit** of $$x$$. Suppose $$G_x$$ is finite and write

$$G_x = \{x_1=x, x2,\cdots,x_n\} = \{g_1x,g_2x,\cdots,g_nx\}$$

for some $$g_i \in G$$. Set 

$$G_i = \{g \in G | gx=x_i\}.$$

It is clear that $$G$$ is the *disjoint union* of all $$G_i$$. Moreover,

$$G_1 = \{g \in G | gx=x\}$$

is also called the **stabilizer** of $$x$$ in $$G$$, denoted by $$\text{Stab}_G(x)$$, which is a subgroup of $$G$$.

> $$G$$-orbit of $$x$$: 將 $$G$$ 內的所有變換加諸於 $$x$$ 身上，所形成的集合；$$G_i$$ 只取可使 $$x$$ 變換成 $$x_i$$ 的部分。

> **stabilizer** 使 $$x$$ 保持不變，因此稱其穩。

> $$g_ix = x_i$$.

### Lemma (stabilizer)
> $$g_iG_1 = G_i$$ for all $$i$$.

**Proof**

Consider the map $$\phi_i: G_1 \to G_i$$, given by $$\phi_i(g) = g_ig$$. We have for all $$g \in G_1$$, $$\phi_i(g)x = g_igx = g_ix = x_i$$. Therefore, $$\phi_i(g) \in G_i$$.

On the other hand, let $$\rho_i: G_i \to G_1$$ given by $$\rho_i(g) = g_1^{-1}g$$. Since both $$\rho_i \circ \phi_i$$ and $$\phi_i \circ \rho_i$$ are equal to the identity map, $$\rho_i$$ is the inver map of $$\phi_i$$.

Hence, $$\phi_i$$ is a bijection, which implies that

$$|G_1| = |G_i|$$

and $$G_i = g_iG_1$$. ◼

> identity map: $$f(x) = x$$.

## The Group of Symmetries of a Regular $$N$$-gon

> 正多邊形

Let $$X$$ be a regular $$n$$-gon with the group of symmetries $$G$$. Let $$o$$ be the center of $$X$$ and $$x$$ be one of its vertex. We first have that $$G_x$$ is equal to **the set of $$n$$ vertices of $$X$$**. Moreover,

$$G_x = \{x, \sigma(x),\cdots,\sigma^{n-1}(x)\},$$

where $$\sigma$$ is the **rotation** around the center $$o$$ of $$2\pi/n$$ degree.

> 在 symmetry 下，頂點只能變換到另一頂點，所以 $$G_x$$ is equal to **the set of $$n$$ vertices of $$X$$**.

And the elements in the stabilizer $$\text{Stab}_G(x)$$ must fix the line $$\overline{ox}$$. Thus, $$\text{Stab}_G(x) = \{e,\tau \}$$, where $$\tau$$ is the **refection** through $$\overline{ox}$$. 

Thus we have

$$|G| = |G_x||\text{Stab}_G(x)| = 2n$$

and 

$$G = \bigcup^n_{i=0}\sigma^i\{e,\tau\} = \{e,\sigma,\cdots,\sigma^{n-1},\tau,\sigma\tau,\cdots,\sigma^{n-1}\tau\}.$$

Finally, we have $$\sigma \tau = \tau \sigma^{-1}$$. Especially, $$G$$ is not **abelian**.

>$$\tau' = \sigma \tau = (\tau')^{-1} = \tau^{-1}\sigma^{-1} = \tau \sigma^{-1}.$$

### Dihedral group

The group of a **regular $$n$$-gon** is called the **dihedral group**, denoted by $$D_n$$, which is a group generated by $$\tau$$ and $$\sigma$$ satisfiying the following conditions:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma^n = \tau^2 = e, \tag{1} \\ 
\sigma \tau = \tau\sigma^{-1} \tag{2}.
\end{eqnarray}$$

$$(2)$$ implies that every element in the group can be written as the form 

$$\sigma^i \tau^j.$$

Therefore, if a group satisfies the above conditions, it hat **at most $$2n$$ elements**. $$(2)$$ also uniquely determiines a binary structure, i.e. the above conditions **uniquely determined the group structure of $$D_n$$**, and we use the following notation as well:

$$D_n = \langle \sigma, \tau | \sigma^n = \tau^2 = e,\ \sigma \tau = \tau \sigma^{-1} \rangle,$$

which **defines a group by generators and relations**.
