## Theorem (smallest subgroup of $$G$$)
Let $$G$$ be a group and let $$a \in G$$. Then 

$$H = \{a^n | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

is a subgroup of $$G$$ and it is the **smallest subgroup of $$G$$** that contains $$a$$, i.e. every subgroup containing $$a$$ contains $$H$$.

> identity: $$a^0 = e$$; inverse: $$a^{-n}a^n = e$$

### Definition (cyclic subgroup)
> Let $$G$$ be a group and $$a \in G$$. Then the subgroup $$\{a^n:n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$$ is called the **cyclic subgroup generated by $$a$$**, and denoted by $$\langle a \rangle$$.

### Definition (cyclic group)
> A group $$G$$ is **cyclic** if $$G = \langle a \rangle$$ for some element $$a \in G$$. The element $$a$$ is called a **generator** for $$G$$.

**Generator** for a cyclic group $$G$$ is not necessarily unique. For example, under addition,  $$\mathbb{Z}_n = \langle \bar 1 \rangle = \langle \overline{n-1} \rangle$$.

> Note: **Being cyclic** is a [structural property](../4-Groups/#structural-properties).

### Definition (order)
> If $$\langle a \rangle$$ has a finite number of element, then the **order of $$a$$** is the order \|$$\langle a \rangle$$\| of this subgroup; otherwie, we say $$a$$ is of **infinite order**.

### Theorem (order)
> Let $$G = \langle a \rangle$$ be a cyclic group. If $$a^r = a^s$$ for some $$r > s$$. Then $$G$$ contains *at most* $$r - s$$ elements.

**Proof**

Let $$m = r - s$$. By [Cancellation Law](../4-Groups/#cancellation-law), we have $$a^m = e$$. For any $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$, by division algorithm, we can write $$n=qm + r$$ with $$0 \leq r < m$$. Then $$a^n = a^{qm+r} = (a^m)^qa^r = a^r$$. Therefore, every element of $$G$$ is equal to one of $$a^0, \cdots, a^{m-1}$$. ◼

### Theorem (infinite cyclic groups)
> Let $$G = \langle a \rangle$$ be an infinite cyclic group. Then $$a^r \not = a^s$$ for all integers $$r \not = s$$. Moreover, $$G \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.

**Proof**

If $$a^r = a^s$$ for some $$r > s$$, applying [this theorem](#theorem-order) would lead to a contradiction.

Then we can define $$\phi: G \to \mathbb{Z}$$ by $$\phi(a^m) = m$$, which is a group isomorphism. ◼

### Theorem (finite cyclic group)
> Let $$G = \langle a \rangle$$ be a cyclic group of *order $$n$$*. Then $$G = \{a^0, a^1, \cdots, a^{n-1}\}$$ and $$a^0 = a^n = e$$. Moreover, $$G \cong \mathbb{Z}_n.$$

**Proof**

If $$a^r = a^s$$ for some $$r > s$$, applying [this theorem](#theorem-order) would lead to a contradiction.

Now we have $$a^n = a^r$$ for some $$0 \leq r \leq n-1$$. In this case, $$G$$ contains at most $$n - r$$ elements, so we must have $$r = 0$$. 

Next we define $$\phi: G \to \mathbb{Z}$$ by $$\phi(a^k) = \bar k$$. 

> 剩下請自行思考（homomorphism）。

#### Corollary
> Let $$a$$ be an element of a group $$G$$. Suppose $$a$$ is of finite order $$n$$. Then $$a^r = a^s \iff r \equiv s \mod n$$.

## Theorem (subgroups of cyclic groups)
> A subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

### Proof
Let $$G = \langle a \rangle$$ be a cyclic group, and $$H$$ be a subgroup. If $$H = \{e\}$$, then $$H = \langle e \rangle$$, which is cyclic.

Now suppose $$H \not = \{e\}$$, then $$a^n \in H$$ for some positive integer $$n$$. Let $$m$$ be the smallest positive integer such that $$a^m \in H$$, and set $$c = a^m$$.

We claim that $$H = \langle c \rangle$$.

Since $$\langle c \rangle$$ is the smallest subgroup containing $$c$$, so we have $$\langle c \rangle \subseteq H$$.

Let $$b \in H$$. Since $$H \subset G = \langle a \rangle, b = a^n$$ for some $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$. By the division algorithm, there exist integers $$q$$ and $$r$$ with $$0 \leq r < m$$ sucht that $$n = qm + r$$.

Now $$a^r = a^{n - qm} = bc^{-q} \in H$$ because $$b, c \in H$$.

By the assumption that $$m$$ is the smallest positive integer such that $$a^m \in H$$ but $$r < m$$, we must have $$r = 0$$. That is , $$b = c^q \in \langle c \rangle$$; $$H \subseteq \langle c \rangle$$.

Hence we have shown that

$$H = \langle c \rangle. \tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$

> 具體來想，$$G = \mathbb{Z} = \langle 1 \rangle, H = \langle 5 \rangle$$，在加法之下。

### Corollary
> The *subgroups* of $$\mathbb{Z}$$ under addition are precisely the groups $$n\mathbb{Z}$$ under addition for $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$.

> $$n\mathbb{Z} = \langle n \rangle$$, under addition.

### Theorem (subgroups of finite cyclic groups)
Let $$G$$ be a cyclic group of **order** $$n$$ generated by $$a$$. Let $$b = a^s$$ and $$d = \gcd(n, s)$$. Then

$$\langle b \rangle = \langle a^d \rangle = \{a^0=e, a^d, a^{2d}, \cdots, a^{n-d}\}.$$

**Proof**

It is sufficient to show that $$a^d \in \langle b  \rangle$$ and $$b \in \langle a^d \rangle$$.

For $$d = \gcd(n, s)$$, there exist integers $$x, y$$ such that $$nx + sy = d$$. Thus, we have $$a^d = a^{nx+sy} = (a^n)^xa^{sy} = (e)^xa^{sy} = b^y \in \langle b \rangle$$. On the other hand, we cand wirte $$s = ds'$$ for some integer $$s'$$. Then $$b = a^s =  (a^d)^{s'} \in \langle a^d \rangle$$. ◼

#### Corollary $$\rm I$$
> $$\langle a^r \rangle = \langle a^s \rangle$$ if and only if $$\gcd(n, r) = \gcd(n, s)$$.

#### Corollary $$\rm II$$
> The other generators of $$G$$ are the elements of the form $$a^r$$, where $$\gcd(n ,r) = 1$$.

#### Corollary $$\rm III$$
> Every subgroup of $$G$$ is equal to $$\langle a^d \rangle$$ for $$d$$\|$$n$$. Especially, **the number of subgroups** of $$G$$ is equal to **the number of divisors of $$n$$**.

> $$\mathbb{Z}_{12}$$ 有 $$6$$ 個 subgroups。

#### Corollary $$\rm IV$$
> When $$G = \mathbb{Z}_n$$, every subgroup is equal to $$\langle \bar d \rangle$$ for some $$d$$\|$$n$$. Moreover, the **order** of the subgroup is equal to $$n/d$$.

> $$n/d: \{0, d, 2d, \cdots, (n/d-1)d\}$$.
