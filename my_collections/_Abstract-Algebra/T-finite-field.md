## Propositions
> - The characteristic $$\text{char}(F)$$ is either a **prime** or $$0$$.
> - If $$p = \text{char}(F)$$ is a **prime**, then $$F$$ can be regarded as a **field extension of $$\Bbb{Z}_p$$**. 
> - If $$\text{char}(F)=0$$, then $$F$$ can be regraded as a **field extension of $$\Bbb Q$$**.

**Proof** (prop. 1)

Suppose $$\text{char}(F) = n < \infty$$. If $$n$$ is composite, $$n=ab$$ for some $$a,b\in \Bbb{Z}^+$$. 

Then

$$
0 = n \cdot 1 = (a\cdot 1)(b \cdot 1).
$$

This implies that $$a = 0$$ or $$b = 0$$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $$n$$ is either prime or $$0$$. ◼
